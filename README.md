# Airwolf2023
A re-creation of the infamous Airwolf from the Amstrad CPC (1984)

Made live on https://www.twitch.tv/alaiing

Rules :
- it's not an emulation thing, I only re-create gameplay
- sprites were found there : https://www.spriters-resource.com/ (or sometimes ripped from screenshots from an emulator)
- musics and sounds are re-made with my mouth ðŸ˜®
- Time constraint: it's made in a total of 7 streaming sessions (~4H each)
- I may not re-implement everything due to the time constraint. But I'll do my best :D

Made using MonoGame (https://monogame.net/). 

Since it's made 100% live and that I'm learning MonoGame as I go, the code can be a bit unstructured with lots of quick and dirty bits. In other words: it's not in any way an example of how to code a game ðŸ˜…. DO NOT DO THIS AT HOME.
